# E-Bike Survey Response Predictive Model

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model on whether or not your household has access to a motorized vehicle.  

## Steps:
1. Import the data
2. Data Cleaning/Feature Engineering
3. Pre Process for XGBoost
4. Sample data/partition
5. Run the data on XG Boost make the prediction

## Results:
The model has an error rate for 13% on the validation dataset.
